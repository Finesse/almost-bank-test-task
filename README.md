The task is described more detailed here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xzUc-OAC-R7_i1DDoTnJ9wcjivK1S4b5Z-liiZurfPo/edit

## How to run the application

1. Download the repository
2. Open a terminal and go to the project directory
3. Run `npm install`
4. Run `npm start`
5. Open http://localhost:3000 in a browser

If you want to deploy it on a server, do steps 1-3 and then run `npm run build`.
A `build` directory will be created in the project directory. Serve the content of the directory by your server.

## How to test

Some checks are performed during `npm start` and `npm run build`. But there are also explicit tests. Run `npm test` to run them.
